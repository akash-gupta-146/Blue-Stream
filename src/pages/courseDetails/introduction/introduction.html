                    As a Practice we are aware that violence and/or aggression may form part of a patient illness, in these circumstances, a discussion will be held with the patient and this should form part of their care plan. This information will be then be recorded in the patient's medical record and flagged to ensure that staff are aware. In addition, where it is deemed necessary, appropriate support will be put in place, e.g. the staff member does not see the patient alone.
